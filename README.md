# project-988

This project is about creating a smart retail assistant mobile application that aims to revolutionize the supermarket experience by addressing the needs of multicultural communities and people with special needs across Australia. The key features of the app include real-time language translation, voice interaction for visually impaired users, and image recognition for instant product information retrieval. The project aims to overcome language barriers, improve accessibility, and enhance convenience for customers during their shopping experience.
